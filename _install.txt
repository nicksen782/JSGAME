# DIRECTIONS: Make a new folder for everything then run this script from that folder.
# You will need to rename the script to install.sh and do chmod +x install.sh on it.
# The script renames itself afterwards.
# The rest is handled automatically.
# This will create the base directory structure and do a git clone of JS_GAME.
# Since it will be a fresh clone there likely will not be a gameslist.json file
# so a starter file will be created.
# Additionally, the game JS_GAME: Tetris will be included.
#
# If you want a Docker container then uncomment the "DOCKER SECTION" near the bottom.
#
# If you just want to install directly from the Github repo you can use one of these commmands:
#   wget -O -  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicksen782/JSGAME/master/_install.txt | bash -s DOCKER
#   curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicksen782/JSGAME/master/_install.txt | bash -s DOCKER
#   wget -O -  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicksen782/JSGAME/master/_install.txt | bash
#   curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicksen782/JSGAME/master/_install.txt | bash
