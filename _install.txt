# DIRECTIONS: Make a new folder for everything then run this script from that folder.
# You will need to rename the script to install.sh and do chmod +x install.sh on it.
# The script renames itself afterwards.
# The rest is handled automatically.
# This will create the base directory structure and do a git clone of JS_GAME.
# Since it will be a fresh clone there likely will not be a gameslist.json file
# so a starter file will be created.
# Additionally, the game JS_GAME: Tetris will be included.

# Make the directory structure.
mkdir JS_GAME
mkdir JS_GAME/APP
mkdir JS_GAME/JS_GAMES

# Enter the JS_GAME directory and then clone JS_GAME into APP.

# Test for the existence of the gamelist.json file.
destfile=APP/gamelist.json
if [ ! -f "$destfile" ]
then
# The file was not found. Create a starter gamelist.jsonfile with JS_GAME: Tetris.
